The current prototype structure lacks definition, requiring employees to go to the top floor to punch in. If the punch-in system were located on the bottom floor, this inconvenience could be avoided. Additionally, the absence of multiple toilets for both gents and ladies on the same floor forces us to go to other floors, which is quite inconvenient. Despite these issues, everything else is satisfactory. The communication team has been working diligently to ensure that every batch receives the necessary information, and their involvement is highly appreciated.
