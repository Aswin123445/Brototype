This week, there are no major concerns to report. The communication team is doing an excellent job, keeping everything on track and ensuring smooth operations. However, there are still some issues with the lift in the hub that need attention. It would be great if the hub could be open on Sundays starting from 9 AM, as this would provide more flexibility for everyone. Additionally, it might be beneficial for the QA team, like the communication team, to organize and conduct technical programs, as this would help keep the environment engaging and foster more learning opportunities for everyone involved.
