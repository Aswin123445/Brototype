This week went really well overall. We had a wonderful Christmas celebration, which was a highlight. After that, I traveled to my hometown for a week, so I wasn’t at the hub. Because of this, I don’t have much detailed feedback for this week. However, I noticed the leave structure might need some restructuring since I could only take three days of leave for a full week away. It would be great if we could revisit this to make it more flexible for similar situations in the future.
