This week at Brototype was smooth for me. because the finally i got a good place to sit and concentrate on my study . Other than communication section is also improving at day by day i am getting more time to communicate with people in English this really heps to improve my language also the fluency in English. 
     the punching machine also installed in the first floor which is a good sign know we don't to go to the third floor to mark our attendance . but the only problem is that the lift is not working and someone need to do something to make this lift work so that i can reach my desined floor as soon as possible.
other thing i forgot to mention is that reviews are getting more and more taught for people like me and somebody should take care this and make the reviews to reduce the size
