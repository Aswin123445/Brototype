The task that was originally planned to be completed last week ended up taking almost two months, likely due to unforeseen circumstances. However, over the past month, many things have happened, and overall, everything has been moving in a positive direction. The communication team has been doing an excellent job, which has significantly helped me improve my communication skills. On another note, construction work in the basement is still ongoing, and it would be better to accelerate the progress to complete it sooner. Additionally, the recurring issue with the lift is worth mentioning, as it sometimes stops working. Addressing this problem promptly would improve convenience and reliability.
