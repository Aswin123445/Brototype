The past week has been a mix of positives and some challenges that need attention. On the bright side, the prototype work has been going really well. The food court is almost finished, and it’s looking good. This is a big step forward, and the progress here is something to feel proud of.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. One of the major problems is with the lifts—they’re still causing trouble, and it’s becoming something that needs immediate fixing. It’s not just a minor inconvenience; it’s something that could impact the overall experience.

Another concern is with the communication department. Their performance hasn’t been as strong as it was last month. For some reason, they’re not conducting public sessions like before, which used to be a great way to engage with people and share updates. This drop in activity is noticeable and needs to be worked on.

Also, there are too many bugs in the app provided by Brototype. It’s frustrating because these issues are slowing things down. Fixing the app quickly would make a big difference and be really helpful moving forward.

So, while there’s good progress in some areas, like the food court, these other issues need to be sorted out soon to keep things on track.
